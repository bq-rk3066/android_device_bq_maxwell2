# This file is the build configuration for a full Android
# build for maxwell2 hardware. This cleanly combines a set of
# device-specific aspects (drivers) with a device-agnostic
# product configuration (apps). Except for a few implementation
# details, it only fundamentally contains two inherit-product
# lines, full and maxwell2, hence its name.

# Inherit from the common open source product configuration
$(call inherit-product, $(SRC_TARGET_DIR)/product/full_base.mk)

# Inherit the maxwell2 definitions
$(call inherit-product, device/bq/maxwell2/device.mk)
$(call inherit-product, vendor/bq/maxwell2/maxwell2-vendor.mk)

# Inherit the rockchip-common definitions
$(call inherit-product, device/bq/rockchip-common/device-common.mk)
$(call inherit-product, vendor/bq/rockchip-common/rockchip-vendor.mk)

# Set those variables here to overwrite the inherited values.
